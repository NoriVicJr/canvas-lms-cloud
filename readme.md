# Canvas LMS Cloud

Automatically configure, deploy, and host the Canvas LMS on everything from a horizontally scaling, fault-tolerant, load balanced private cloud to a simple local virtual machine instance.

---

## Features
* High availability, fault tolerant, and horizontal scaling design
* No dedicated hardware firewalls or load balancers needed
* Nginx used as an SSL terminator, static cache, round-robin load balancer, with SPDY protocol support
* Redis leveraged for improved system performance
* Handling for multiple physical datacenter setups
* Handling for multiple application hosts with round robin load balancing
* Handling for database clusters (e.g. Pgpool II and Postgres-XC)
* Handling for multiple reverse proxies, SSL terminators, static caches, load balancers
* Handling for dedicated application hosts to run automated jobs
* Security hardening at multiple levels

## Server Targeting
Horizontal scaling concepts are used heavily (e.g. numerous servers per role, ability to dynamic add servers per role, load balancing per role, removing single points of failure per role, etc). With this in mind, we specifically target servers with roughly the following specifications:

```
CPU: Intel Xeon E3-1245v3
DISK: Intel SSDs or 10k SATA HDDs in RAID 1/10
RAM 32 GB ECC
NIC: 1 Gbps
IPv4: 1 public
```

These types of servers can be custom built cost-effectively (i.e. $1,200) and leased in large quantities cost-effectively (e.g. $65/month at [SoYouStart](http://www.soyoustart.com/us/offers/sys-e32-4.xml)).

## Cloud Sizes
__Localhost:__
* __Inventory files:__ [localhost](https://github.com/rockymadden/canvas-lms-cloud/blob/master/src/ansible/localhost)
* __Scalability:__ N/A
* __Ideal hosts (min):__ N/A

__Small__
* __Inventory files:__ [production-small](https://github.com/rockymadden/canvas-lms-cloud/blob/master/src/ansible/development-small), [development-small](https://github.com/rockymadden/canvas-lms-cloud/blob/master/src/ansible/development-small), [test-small](https://github.com/rockymadden/canvas-lms-cloud/blob/master/src/ansible/test-small)
* __Scalability:__ Supports multiple datacenter setups. Supports horizontal scaling of proxy, cache, and application hosts. Supports a single vertically scaling database hosts which can leverage a failover sister.
* __Ideal hosts (min):__ 2 proxy hosts, 3 application hosts, 1 cache host, and 2 database hosts.

__Medium:__
* __Inventory files:__ [production-medium](https://github.com/rockymadden/canvas-lms-cloud/blob/master/src/ansible/development-medium), [development-medium](https://github.com/rockymadden/canvas-lms-cloud/blob/master/src/ansible/development-medium), [test-medium](https://github.com/rockymadden/canvas-lms-cloud/blob/master/src/ansible/test-medium)
* __Scalability:__ Supports multiple datacenter setups. Supports horizontal scaling of proxy, cache, and application hosts. Supports [Pgpool II with streaming replication](http://www.pgpool.net/).
* __Ideal hosts (min):__ 2 proxy hosts, 3 application hosts, 1 cache host, 2 database coordinator hosts, 1 database master host, and 1 database slave host.

__Large:__
* __Inventory files:__ [production-large](https://github.com/rockymadden/canvas-lms-cloud/blob/master/src/ansible/development-large), [development-large](https://github.com/rockymadden/canvas-lms-cloud/blob/master/src/ansible/development-large), [test-large](https://github.com/rockymadden/canvas-lms-cloud/blob/master/src/ansible/test-large)
* __Scalability:__ Supports multiple datacenter setups. Supports horizontal scaling of proxy, cache, and application hosts. Supports [Postgres-XC](https://wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Postgres-XC).
* __Ideal hosts (min):__ 2 proxy hosts, 3 application hosts, 1 cache host, 2 database coordinator hosts, 2 database datanode hosts, and 2 database GTM hosts.

## Firewall Design

__Co-Hosts:__
* All ports and protocols are open. Co-host IP addresses are automatically discovered via the Ansible inventory. This is enforced via [iptables rules for all hosts](https://github.com/rockymadden/canvas-lms-cloud/blob/master/src/ansible/roles/common/templates/etc/iptables/rules.v4.j2).

__Administrators:__
* All ports and protocols are open. If your IP address is explicitly defined in [group_vars](https://github.com/rockymadden/canvas-lms-cloud/blob/master/src/ansible/group_vars/all) you are considered an administrator. This is enforced via [iptables rules for all hosts](https://github.com/rockymadden/canvas-lms-cloud/blob/master/src/ansible/roles/common/templates/etc/iptables/rules.v4.j2).

__Public:__
* TCP port 22 is open on all hosts. However, only SSH key authentication is allowed which is enforced via [sshd_config](https://github.com/rockymadden/canvas-lms-cloud/blob/master/src/ansible/roles/common/templates/etc/ssh/sshd_config.j2).
* ICMP echo requests are allowed to all hosts. However, there is a threshold of 5 per second which is enforced via [sysctl.conf](https://github.com/rockymadden/canvas-lms-cloud/blob/master/src/ansible/roles/common/templates/etc/sysctl.conf.j2).
* TCP ports 80 and 443 are open on proxy hosts and __are the only ports intended for public consumption.__ Via Ansible inventory variables, it is possible to rate-limit connections to help protect against abuse and attacks.

## Requirements

Ansible installed locally and one or more Ubuntu 14.04 LTS hosts with:
* OpenSSH server installed
* Network interface and hostname configured
* SSH key transferred
