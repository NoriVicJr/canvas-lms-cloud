# Canvas LMS Cloud <sub><sup>v0.0.2</sup></sub>

Automatically configure, deploy, and host the Canvas LMS on everything from a horizontally scaling, fault-tolerant, load balanced private cloud to a simple local virtual machine instance.

## Features
* High availability, fault tolerant, and horizontal scaling design
* No dedicated hardware firewalls or load balancers needed
* Nginx used as an SSL terminator, static cache, round-robin load balancer, with SPDY protocol support
* Redis leveraged for improved system performance
* Cassandra leveraged for improved system performance
* Handling for multiple physical datacenter setups
* Handling for multiple application hosts with round robin load balancing
* Handling for database clusters (e.g. Pgpool II and Postgres-XC)
* Handling for storage clusters (e.g. GlusterFS) or Amazon S3
* Handling for multiple reverse proxies, SSL terminators, static caches, load balancers
* Handling for dedicated application hosts to run automated jobs
* Security hardening at multiple levels

## Server Targeting
Horizontal scaling concepts are used heavily (e.g. numerous servers per role, ability to dynamic add servers per role, load balancing per role, removing single points of failure per role, etc). With this in mind, we specifically target servers with roughly the following specifications:

```
CPU: Intel Xeon E3-1245v3
DISK: Intel SSDs or 10k enterprise-level SATA HDDs in RAID 1/10
RAM 32 GB ECC
NIC: 1 Gbps (preferably dual)
IPv4: 1 public
```

These types of servers can be custom built cost-effectively (i.e. $1,200) and leased in large quantities cost-effectively (e.g. $65/month at [SoYouStart](http://www.soyoustart.com/us/offers/sys-e32-4.xml)).

## Firewall Design

All publicly available ports/protocols have IP based rate-limiting to help mitigate abuse and attacks (e.g. if you ping more than once a second, your requests are dropped). For details, check out the [iptables rules template](https://github.com/rockymadden/canvas-lms-cloud/blob/master/src/ansible/roles/common/templates/etc/iptables/rules.v4.j2).

### Co-Hosts
---
* All ports and protocols are open. Co-host IP addresses are automatically discovered via the Ansible inventory. This is enforced via [iptables rules for all hosts](https://github.com/rockymadden/canvas-lms-cloud/blob/master/src/ansible/roles/common/templates/etc/iptables/rules.v4.j2).

### Administrators
---
* All ports and protocols are open. If your IP address is explicitly defined in [group_vars](https://github.com/rockymadden/canvas-lms-cloud/blob/master/src/ansible/group_vars/all.example), you are considered an administrator. This is enforced via [iptables rules for all hosts](https://github.com/rockymadden/canvas-lms-cloud/blob/master/src/ansible/roles/common/templates/etc/iptables/rules.v4.j2).

### Public
---
* ICMP echo requests are allowed to all hosts.
* TCP port 22 is open on all hosts. However, only SSH key authentication is allowed which is enforced via [sshd_config](https://github.com/rockymadden/canvas-lms-cloud/blob/master/src/ansible/roles/common/templates/etc/ssh/sshd_config.j2).
* TCP ports 80 and 443 are open on proxy hosts and __are the only ports intended for public consumption.__

```

---

Perform apt maintenance on all production application hosts:
```
$ ansible-playbook -i localhost apt_upgrade.yml --limit=application
$ ansible-playbook -i production_small apt_upgrade.yml --limit=application
